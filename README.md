# rainbow-role-bot
This is a python script that makes any role on discord change colors every 10 seconds. To work this, go on to replit.com and create a python repl and paste this code in. The rest is self explanatory if u know python or how to use replit.

If u dont know how to use this, ill tell u. Make sure u have a application that u wanna use as the bot on discord developer portal. if not create on. then go to the secrets tab on replit and create a new one called "TOKEN" make sure its uppercase and make the value ur application token. Make sure you enable the necessary permissions too.

Once done, run the repl and boom.

If u need any other help using this, dm Frojy on dc for help.
